I’m interested in working across boundaries and disciplines to best leverage everyone’s unique skill-set and expertise.",

    "I graduated in Biomedical Engineering and worked on new medical device development for two years before deciding to pursue a Master of Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University in 2019.",
    
    "I believe in the creative potential of individuals and communities to solve their own problems and hope to develop technology to help them realize this potential. I’m a ‘systems thinker’ and believe that in order to solve the right problems, we need to understand the systems(relationships, habits, environments) that lead to problematic outcomes, then work to design better ones."
